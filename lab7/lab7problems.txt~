Lab 7 Problems: Digital Design II

Remember to solve these individually, working with your partner only when
you get stuck, and seeking help from the TA only when you are both stuck.
You may NOT use any calculators.  Make sure you are on your own computer,
editing your own file.

This is your assignment for the week, not just for the day, so it is
expected that you will not finish during this lab time.

For each problem, make sure you write your answer on the line immediately
after the prompt, and only on that line.  For example:

0.) What is 2 + 2, in decimal?
0.answer)
4

---PART 1: MORE K-MAPS---

Each of the problems has the same process.
1: Identify the inputs and outputs
 - this will be given for you to make sure we all name them the same
2: Write the truth table
 - we will give you the table to fill in.  Make sure you do not
   reorder the rows.
3: Unoptimized Sum of products.  Make sure you format the answers correctly.
  - AND is not shown (place next to each other), OR is '+', and NOT is '!'
  - whitespace does not matter.
  - place your entire answer on one line
  - The order in which products occur doesn't matter

ex. B A | C
    _______
    0 0 | 0
    0 1 | 1
    1 0 | 1
    1 1 | 0

C = !BA + B!A

4: Draw K-map yourself on a piece of paper
5: Write out the minimized sum of products, using the K-map as a guide



1.) Given this truth table, do steps 2-4.
  A B C D | O
  ___________
  0 0 0 0 | 0
  0 0 0 1 | 1
  0 0 1 0 | 0
  0 0 1 1 | 0
  0 1 0 0 | 1
  0 1 0 1 | 0
  0 1 1 0 | 1
  0 1 1 1 | 0
  1 0 0 0 | 0
  1 0 0 1 | 1
  1 0 1 0 | 0
  1 0 1 1 | 0
  1 1 0 0 | 0
  1 1 0 1 | 0
  1 1 1 0 | 0
  1 1 1 1 | 0

Unoptimized Sum of Products equation
1a) O = !A!B!CD + !AB!C!D + !ABC!D +A!B!CD

Draw the K-map and simplify
Optimized Sum of Products equation
1b) O = !AB!D + !CD!B

2.) Given this truth table, do steps 2-4.
    Note the use of don't-cares, represented by `X`.
  A B C D | O
  ___________
  0 0 0 0 | 1
  0 0 0 1 | X
  0 0 1 0 | 0
  0 0 1 1 | 1
  0 1 0 0 | X
  0 1 0 1 | 0
  0 1 1 0 | X
  0 1 1 1 | 0
  1 0 0 0 | X
  1 0 0 1 | 0
  1 0 1 0 | 1
  1 0 1 1 | 0
  1 1 0 0 | 1
  1 1 0 1 | 0
  1 1 1 0 | X
  1 1 1 1 | 0

Unoptimized Sum of Products equation
2a) O =!A!B!C!D + !A!BCD + A!BC!D + AB!C!D

Draw the K-map and simplify
Optimized Sum of Products equation
2b) O = !C!D + !A!BD + A!B!D


---PART 2: MULTIPLEXERS---

For your answers for this part, put your answer on the SAME LINE as the
prompt.  For example:

What is 2 + 8?
ex) 10


3) The 8-input MUX can be constructed entirely with 2-input MUXes.
I will start you out - put inputs A and B into one MUX and inputs C and D
into another MUX. Continue on with E F and G H like this.
This is the first stage of the solution.
Then decide how to reconcile the two results from those MUXes.
Look hard at the logic for the 2-input MUX vs the 8-input MUX.

How many 2-input MUXes are needed to create an 8-input MUX?
3a) 4

How many select lines are needed?
3b) 3

Draw the circuit and include it in your submission as "lab7mux.jpg".
Alternatively, you can draw the circuit on paper and submit it to the
CS64 homework box, in Harold Frank Hall room 2108.  If you submit
to the homework box, be sure to list your name, your partner's name
(if applicable), and write "multiplexer" on it.

4.) Now think of a MUX that has `2^n` inputs.  All of your answers will
have the variable `n` in them.  Please denote exponentials as base^exp,
such as n^2.

How many select bits are there?
4a) (2^n) - 1

If it is implemented with 2-input MUXes, how many MUXes are there in 
the first stage?
4b) (2^n)/2

How many 2-input MUXes are there in the second stage?
4c) (2^n)/4

How many stages of 2-input MUXes are there?
4d) n
