Lab 1 problems: Data representation and bitwise operations

Remember to solve these individually, working with your partner only when
you get stuck, and seeking help from the TA only when you are both stuck.
You may NOT use any calculators.  Make sure you are on your own computer,
editing your own file.

This is your assignment for the week, not just for the day, so it is 
expected that you will not finish during this lab time.  

For each problem, make sure you write your answer on the line immediately
after the prompt.  For example:

0.) What is 2 + 2, in decimal?
0.answer)
4


---Text Editor Usage---

1.) Count how many instances there are of the word "decimal" in this file,
    including the one on the previous line. You can use your text editor's
    applicable command for searching for a particular word.  Note that
    the related word "hexadecimal" does NOT count.
1.answer)
28

---Values of Different Bases---

The following questions ask you what value a given number has
for a given number in a given base.  Write your answers in exponent
form (10^3) or a number multiplied by the exponent form (11*10^4).
Keep in mind that we start from position 0.
For example:

2.) In decimal, how much is a 1 in position 3 worth?
2.answer)
10^3


3.) In binary, how much is a 1 in position 4 worth?
3.answer)
2^5

4.) In octal, how much is a 1 in position 4 worth?
4.answer)
8^5

5.) In hexadecimal, how much is a 1 in position 4 worth?
5.answer)
16^5

6.) In hexadecimal, how much is a 2 in position 4 worth?
6.answer)
2*16^5

7.) In hexadecimal, how much is a B in position 4 worth?
7.answer)
11*16^5

8.) In hexadecimal, how much is a 9 in position 5 worth?
8.answer)
9*16^6

24.answer)
0

25.) The leftmost bit of an 8-bit number is in what position?
25.answer)
7

26.) The rightmost bit of a 16-bit number is in what position?
26.answer)
0

27.) The leftmost bit of a 16-bit number is in what position?
27.answer)
15

28.) What is the 4-bit binary number that contains a 0 in all
     positions except for the second position?
28.answer)
0100


---Bit-Level Properties---

     is equivalent to multipling N by what (in decimal)?
29.answer)
2

30.) Shifting an unsigned binary number N one position to the right
     is equivalent to performing truncating division (ignoring the
     remainder) by what (in decimal)?
30.answer)     
2

31.) What is the decimal result of shifting the unsigned binary
     number '0001' one position to the right?
31.answer)
0

     is equivalent to multipling N by what (in decimal)?
32.answer)
8

33.) Shifting an unsigned binary number N four positions to the right
     is equivalent to performing truncating division (ignoring the
     remainder) by what (in decimal)?
